## What is Dependency Walker?

**Dependency Walker** is a powerful and free utility that scans any Windows module (exe, dll, ocx, sys, etc.) and builds a hierarchical tree diagram of all dependent modules. For each module found, it lists all the functions that are exported by that module, and which of those functions are actually being called by other modules. 

This tool is incredibly valuable for troubleshooting system errors related to missing DLL files, invalid imports, circular dependency errors, and module compatibility issues. It helps developers, system administrators, and IT professionals diagnose why an application fails to load or run correctly by providing a detailed analysis of its binary dependencies.

With Dependency Walker, users can perform deep analysis of 32-bit and 64-bit modules, profile the module execution to see which functions are called and how much time is spent in each function, and save profile data for later viewing. Its comprehensive reporting makes it an indispensable tool for debugging complex software issues and ensuring application stability across different Windows environments.
